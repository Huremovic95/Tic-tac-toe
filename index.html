                <p>Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players 
                    who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds
                     in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
                     It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt,
                     where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
                    An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. 
                    It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, 
                    each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. 
                    The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.</p>
